# ETF-Price-Prediction
This project used ETF data that was sourced from Yahoo Finance using an API. Time series data was collected from 2015 to the present day.

The purpose of this project was to use the existing time series data to predict the ETF prices for a specified timeframe, such as the next couple days.

This analysis did a 70% training data and 30% testing data split using an ARIMA model for price prediction.
Forecast error statistics were also calculated to compare the model to the actual prices.

The R script and output using Jupyter Notebooks via the Visual Studio Code editor is attached above as "NHL Win Prediction.ipynb".
